## 🎯 Case Study  
This project simulates a real-world business scenario where a company needed to analyze historical sales data spread across multiple Excel sheets from 2015 to 2018.

The original data was fragmented, inconsistent, and difficult to analyze. To solve this, I used Power Query to append all sheets into a single dataset, applied data cleaning techniques to ensure accuracy, and built relationships using Power Pivot.

The goal was to create an interactive Excel dashboard that allows stakeholders to:
- Track sales performance over four years  
- Compare year-over-year trends  
- Identify top-performing products and regions  
- Understand seasonal or monthly patterns in sales  
- Make data-driven decisions in sales, inventory, and marketing strategies
- ...I used Power Query to append all sheets into a single dataset, applied data cleaning techniques to ensure accuracy, and built a data model consisting of fact and dimension tables (Sales, Product, Customer) using Power Pivot.

This case study demonstrates how Excel can be a powerful tool for business intelligence, even without external BI software.
